Use cowboy to do the exercises from https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Development_with_Webmachine_for_Erlang

The claim on that web page that "The only thing to be changed is the handling of strings." is at best misleading.
For the full benefit of the exercises, one must of course do them oneself.
